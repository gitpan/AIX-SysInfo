Revision history for Perl extension AIX::SysInfo.

1.1             2009-06-16
		sleonov@cpan.org SLEONOV
                - Rewritten from scratch
                - Added lpar_info and lpar_id
                - Changed many functions on how they obtain system information
                - Dropped support for original sys_arch and model_type due to
                  the fact it is useless for newer pSeries hardware.
                  Instead I simply use "uname -M"
